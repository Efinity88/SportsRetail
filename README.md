# SportsRetail
- In this project I used SQL skills to analyze product data for an online sports retail company.
- I used differnet techniques such as aggregation, cleaning, labeling, Common Table Expressions, and correlation.
- Analyzing the data allowed me to produce recommendations on how the company can maximize revenue!
- This was carried out on DataCamp https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/optimizing_online_revenue/guided/SQL
